Sprint 3 Review:

- We had to leave some of the work for the next sprint, but this is because we had new ideas for the software
- Most of the features now have a good foundation
- We polished most of the code, making the program much easier to develop on for future developers


Sprint 3 Retrospective:

- We need to find a better way to use version control system since it's giving us too much irreversible problems
- Make better documentation on each script so that it is easier to review the code
- Make BPMN diagrams for each US
