Sprint 1 Review:

- We managed to do everything we had planned for the Sprint with success
- We thought communication with members from different countries would be hard
but everyone made a big effort so everything went smoothly


Sprint 1 Retrospective:

- Make an estimation for all User Stories before the sprint starts
- Really be clear about the needs of the client so we can accurately build all
User Stories without missing any feature
- Make better documentation on each script so that it is easier to review the code
- Improve the project's architecture in a way that makes it more organized and easier 
to scale
- Make BPMN diagrams for each US
